# Restaurant-Manager4
I was able to figure out how to sucessfully connect the health checker to the databases using the database health checker. Now once I call the health endpoint, it should return a Healthy status every time as long as the database connections are intact. Using the DatabaseHealthCheck class, It should make sure that the health check can connect to the database and include a log to record a success message at every successfull connection, otherwise, it will give a message that the database was unreachable and return an unhealthy status. I have added a health check in Program.cs to apply the mapping of the health endpoint so it will return healthy at every succesfull database connection and unhealthy at every connection failure once I run the application using the created DatabaseHealthCheck class. I have tested to ensure it will return unhealty when appending /healthz by modifying the database conntection in appsettings.json in RestaurantManagerContext. Once I change the connection strings in RestaurantManagerContext, it will return an unhealthy status as it should. These factors would prove that AddHealthChecks and MapHealthChecks will run the health checks properly and therefore connect to the database rather than always returning a Healthy status by default no matter the health of the database.
